This is the Producer-Consumer problem built within C++ using the Boost libraries for Concurrency, The buffer is a Vector of Strings in which the Producer generates random strings and places them into the buffer, Whilst the Consumer fetches them out and prints them to Console. This has been tested for both Eclipse and g++ on the command line.
